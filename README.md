# 📌 Project Overview  

## 🔍 Objective  
Build a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee will be promoted based on historical data of employees, enabling fair and data-driven promotion decisions.  

## 🧩 Problem Statement  
Traditional promotion processes often lack transparency and fairness. By leveraging employee data, this project provides a predictive solution to identify high-potential employees objectively.

# 📊 Project Workflow  

### 🔹 Step 1: Understanding the Problem  
✔ Input data: Employee details (department, education, rating, training scores, etc.)  
✔ Output: Predict promotion (Yes/No)  

### 🔹 Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✔ Bar plots – Department-wise promotion trends  
✔ Box plots – Ratings & training scores distribution  
✔ Heatmaps – Correlation between features  

### 🔹 Step 3: Data Cleaning  
✨ Missing Values – Filled with mode (categorical) & median (numerical)  
✨ Removed irrelevant columns (Employee ID)  

### 🔹 Step 4: Feature Encoding  
✔ Used Label Encoding for categorical features  
✔ Works effectively for tree-based models like XGBoost  

### 🔹 Step 5: Model Building (XGBoost)  
⚡ Train-Test Split (80:20)  
⚡ Model trained & validated on structured data  
⚡ Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall (due to imbalance)  

### 🔹 Step 6: Final Predictions  
📂 Predictions saved as CSV  
📈 Helps HR teams identify employees likely to be promoted  

### 🔹 Step 7: Learnings & Impact  
✔ Handling real-world employee data  
✔ Dealing with missing values & imbalanced dataset  
✔ Deploying end-to-end predictive model
